Django DMS provides both a couple of simple document management apps and framework for quickly creating your own customised DMS apps.

Framework features include:
  * Documents can be downloaded, previewed or emailed to the user
  * Generic views for listing or displaying documents, with Django admin-like interface
  * Objects can be automatically populated using metadata stored in uploaded file

More information can be found in the HowTo or of course the source code :-) At this stage (late January 2009) Django-DMS is under constant change, so let me know if you have any ideas or would like to contribute in any way (see the ToDo).
